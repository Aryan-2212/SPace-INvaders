## Project Description:

This is a retro-style Space Invaders game developed using Python and the Pygame library. It is a 
simple yet classic arcade game where the player controls a spaceship and shoots at invading 
enemies. The objective is to destroy all the enemies before they reach the bottom of the screen, 
all while avoiding their attacks.

In this project, you'll control a spaceship that can move left and right and shoot bullets at enemies 
that descend from the top of the screen. The enemies respawn at random positions once they are 
destroyed, and the game becomes progressively more challenging as you eliminate them.

**Features:**
- Move the player spaceship left and right using arrow keys.
* Shoot bullets upwards to destroy enemies using the spacebar.
+ Enemies move downwards and respawn after being hit.
- Simple collision detection between bullets and enemies.
* Real-time game loop with basic graphics and animations.

**Technologies Used:**

- Python: The main programming language used to write the game logic.
* Pygame: A Python library used to create 2D games. It handles the game window,
  user input, sprite management, and more.
